# dotMeme

dotMeme is a program that allows you to make memes using JSON!

## Usage
Do `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies. Then do:

```bash
node . foo.meme (or any json file with the right contents)
```

## Creating a .meme
A .meme file is just a regular JSON file, but renamed to an extension i thought was appropiate.

You can mess around with the values in `template.meme` to manipulate how the assembled image looks like.
